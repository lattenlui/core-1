  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"

  Scenario: send DELETE requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
